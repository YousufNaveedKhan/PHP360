# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

## Overview  
OOP is a paradigm that organizes code around objects and classes.  

## Key Principles  
1. **Encapsulation**: Protects data by bundling it with methods.  
2. **Inheritance**: Enables code reuse by creating a parent-child relationship between classes.  
3. **Polymorphism**: Allows methods to behave differently depending on the context.  
4. **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details to focus on essential features.  

## Use Cases  
- Building modular applications.  
- Enhancing code reusability and scalability.  
- Simplifying maintenance and debugging.
